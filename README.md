🚀 FocusForge — AI-Powered Smart Study Planner
FocusForge is a productivity web app designed to help students study smarter, not longer.
I built this app to solve a real problem:
Most students waste time deciding what to study and how to structure their sessions. FocusForge removes that friction by intelligently planning structured study blocks based on available time, topic difficulty, and priority.
